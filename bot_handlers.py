💰 **Kelly Criterion Bankroll Management**

**Professional Money Management:**

**Kelly Criterion Formula:**
• Bet% = (bp - q) / b
• b = odds - 1
• p = win probability  
• q = loss probability (1 - p)

**Recommended Bet Sizes:**
• **High Confidence (70%+):** 3-5% of bankroll
• **Medium Confidence (60-70%):** 1-3% of bankroll  
• **Low Confidence (50-60%):** 0.5-1% of bankroll

**Risk Management Rules:**
• Never bet more than 5% on single event
• Use fractional Kelly (25-50% of full Kelly)
• Set stop-loss at 20% of bankroll
• Take profits at 50% gains

**Bankroll Allocation:**
• 60% - Main betting fund
• 25% - High-value opportunities  
• 10% - Experimental strategies
• 5% - Emergency reserve

**Example Calculation:**
If you have 65% win probability at 2.0 odds:
• Kelly% = (0.65 × 1 - 0.35) / 1 = 30%
• Conservative bet: 7.5% (quarter Kelly)

💡 **Professional Tip:** Start with smaller percentages and increase as you prove profitability.

**Insider Tips:**

• 65% win probability at 1.65 odds = +7.25% edge

**Current Edge Analysis:**
🏀 **NBA Today:**
• Lakers vs Warriors: 58% Lakers win, best odds 1.85 = +7.3% edge
• Clippers vs Suns: 52% Clippers win, best odds 2.10 = +9.2% edge
• Celtics vs Heat: 61% Celtics win, best odds 1.70 = +3.7% edge

**Edge Identification Methods:**
